# Multi-Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Lab

This repository contains example Terraform configurations for provisioning basic infrastructure across major cloud providers: **Azure**, **AWS**, and **GCP**.

## 🌍 Supported Providers

- Azure: Virtual Machines, Networking
- AWS: EC2 Instances, VPCs (coming soon)
- GCP: Compute Engine (coming soon)

## 📦 Structure

Each cloud provider has its own folder with subfolders for specific examples.

## 🧠 Purpose

This is a personal learning sandbox for mastering Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using Terraform across multiple cloud platforms. It started as part of my Azure studies and will grow to include AWS and GCP.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Navigate to the desired cloud provider and follow the instructions in the local README.
