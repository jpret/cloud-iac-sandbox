# Multi-Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Sandbox

This repository contains example Terraform configurations for provisioning basic infrastructure across major cloud providers: **Azure**, **AWS**, and **GCP**.

## üåç Supported Providers

- Azure: Virtual Machines, Networking
- AWS: EC2 Instances, VPCs (coming soon)
- GCP: Compute Engine (coming soon)

## üì¶ Structure

Each cloud provider has its own folder with subfolders for specific examples.

## üß† Purpose

This is a personal learning sandbox for mastering Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) using Terraform across multiple cloud platforms. It started as part of my Azure studies and will grow to include AWS and GCP.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Navigate to the desired cloud provider and follow the instructions in the local README for the specific implementations.

The prerequisitie packages are as follows:
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) - _Note: For windows it can be installed with [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/install)_  
- For Azure install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).
